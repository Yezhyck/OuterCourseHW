   * `Assigment:` 
      Write a game JAVA - a program that guesses a number according to the principle - "more - less":
      * The program must guess an arbitrary number in the range from 0 to 100.
      * The user is offered to try to guess the number by sequentially entering numbers from the range limited first to the numbers 0 and 100, and on further attempts - taking    into account the previously entered numbers. The program should analyze the input for any erroneous user actions.
      * The screen should display the previous attempts, the range in which the required number is and the result of the previous user action.
      * If the numbers match - the program must inform the user about it and display all statistics on the user's actions.
